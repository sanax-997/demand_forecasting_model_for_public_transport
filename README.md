# Model Engineering - Demand Forecasting Model for Public Transport

## Overview
The "Demand Forecasting Model for Public Transport" repository contains the code and data for the analysis of taxi demand in key areas of New York City and the development of a prediction model. The primary objective of this project is to accurately predict demand patterns based on historical taxi pickup data in the ten most important locations of the city. This repository contains all the steps from the preprocessing of data to the evaluation of the finished prediction model. The .ipynb scripts in the repository contain the following:
- feature_generation.ipynb - this script contains all code regarding feature preprocessing
- eda.ipynb (exploratory data analysis - is about the visual exploration of the data
- model_training.ipynb . is about the model training and prediction
